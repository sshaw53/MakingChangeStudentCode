I thought this would help break down the problem significantly and that it would be easier to find the combinations that make up the target if we have identified the combinations for each coin. I plan on solving for these combinations recursively. |
| January 27 | 10:45-11:55am | I spent all of class coming up with an improved concept to my former approach. I ended up working with Liliana and Kate, and I think the best approach is to use memoization and dynamic programming to break up the problem. I start at the zero and use recursion to go to each call that will add either the same coin or any increasing coin, and should continue to check the count. We keep recursing as long as we haven't found a count that equals our target number, and keep the combinations we find along the way for numbers smaller than the target in a map to make the approach faster. |
